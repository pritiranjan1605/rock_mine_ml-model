# Machine Learning Model for Rock vs Mine Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model implemented in Python using the `sklearn` library to predict whether an object detected underwater is a rock or a mine based on sonar data.

## Overview

The model is built using logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, to classify objects detected by sonar signals as either rocks or mines. It takes input features derived from sonar readings and predicts the class label for each object.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Sonar Dataset, which consists of sonar signals bounced off different objects detected underwater. The dataset contains 60 attributes representing the strength of the sonar signal at different frequencies and a target variable indicating whether the object is a rock or a mine.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-mine-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rock-mine-prediction

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook trained_model_for_rock_mine_prediction.ipynb

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
